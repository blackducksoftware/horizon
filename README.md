# Horizon

Horizon is a set of tools to programmatically define an application that will be deployed to a kubernetes based cluster.  This replaces the need to create and provide yaml or json files for the application.  Additionally it supports the ability to define a controller that will be run after all defined parts of the application are deployed.
